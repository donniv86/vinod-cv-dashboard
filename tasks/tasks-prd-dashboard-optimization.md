Based on the PRD requirements for transforming the CV Dashboard into a highly professional, tech-forward platform.

## Relevant Files

### Notes

- Unit tests should be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `CVDashboard.vue` and `CVDashboard.test.ts` in the same directory)
- Use `npm run test` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the test configuration
- Performance optimization should be measured using Lighthouse and Core Web Vitals
- External API integrations should include proper error handling and fallback states
