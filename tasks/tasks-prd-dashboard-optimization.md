# Task List: CV Dashboard Optimization Implementation

Based on the PRD requirements for transforming the CV Dashboard into a highly professional, tech-forward platform.

## Relevant Files

- `src/views/CVDashboard.vue` - Main dashboard component with enhanced hero section featuring animated background effects, particles, floating shapes, and typewriter animations
- `src/components/cv/PersonalInfo.vue` - Enhanced personal info component with sophisticated glassmorphism effects, animated headshot, floating elements, and modern contact panel design
- `src/components/cv/ExperienceTimeline.vue` - Component for interactive career progression timeline
- `src/components/cv/SkillsChart.vue` - Component for technical skills visualization with radar charts
- `src/components/cv/SkillsRadarChart.vue` - Component for radar chart implementation of skills
- `src/components/cv/ProfessionalAnalytics.vue` - Component for research impact and publication metrics
- `src/components/cv/ProjectsGrid.vue` - Component for project portfolio with interactive demos
- `src/components/cv/GitHubProjects.vue` - Component for GitHub integration and project showcase
- `src/components/cv/Publications.vue` - Component for research publications and citation metrics
- `src/components/ui/ProgressIndicator.vue` - Component for loading states and progress indicators
- `src/components/ui/InteractiveTimeline.vue` - Component for enhanced timeline interactions
- `src/composables/useScrollBehavior.ts` - Composable for smooth animations and scroll behavior
- `src/composables/useMultiStepProcess.ts` - Composable for multi-step interactions
- `src/assets/main.css` - Global styles for glassmorphism effects and modern UI patterns
- `src/router/index.ts` - Router configuration for new dashboard routes and transitions
- `index.html` - HTML template for SEO meta tags and structured data
- `vite.config.ts` - Vite configuration for performance optimization and build settings
- `package.json` - Dependencies for data visualization libraries and external integrations

### Notes

- Unit tests should be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `CVDashboard.vue` and `CVDashboard.test.ts` in the same directory)
- Use `npm run test` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the test configuration
- Performance optimization should be measured using Lighthouse and Core Web Vitals
- External API integrations should include proper error handling and fallback states
